Initialization:
  Initialize LM35 sensor pin
  Initialize current sensor pin
  Initialize voltage sensor pin
  Initialize cooling relay pin
  Initialize heating relay pin
  Initialize LCD display with I2C address (0x27)

Setup:
  Begin Serial communication at 115200 baud rate
  Initialize LCD display and turn on backlight
  Configure LM35 sensor pin as INPUT
  Configure current sensor pin as INPUT
  Configure voltage sensor pin as INPUT
  Configure cooling relay pin as OUTPUT
  Configure heating relay pin as OUTPUT
  Set cooling relay to OFF
  Set heating relay to OFF

Loop:
  Read analog value from LM35 sensor pin
  Convert analog value to temperature in Celsius

  Read analog value from current sensor pin
  Convert analog value to current

  Read analog value from voltage sensor pin
  Convert analog value to voltage

  Calculate power as P = V * I

  Accumulate total energy using power and time
  Calculate charging cycles based on total energy and battery capacity

  Print temperature, current, voltage, power, and charging cycles to Serial Monitor
  Display temperature on LCD

  IF temperature > 45°C:
    Turn ON cooling relay
    Display "Cooling ON" on LCD
  ELSE IF temperature < 30°C:
    Turn OFF cooling relay

  IF temperature < 10°C:
    Turn ON heating relay
    Display "Heating ON" on LCD
  ELSE IF temperature > 10°C:
    Turn OFF heating relay

  IF 10°C <= temperature <= 45°C:
    Display "System STABLE" on LCD

  Wait for 1 second
